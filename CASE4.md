# User Story
Futsal is a very refreshing and team building sport. There are so many futsal grounds all over the world. In this project we want to connect futsal ground owners and futsal users. Our main goal in this first sprint is to have basic skeleton ready. 

The main idea here is futsal owners and users can login to their portals.
- Owners will add their grounds.
- Owners will add/update available slots.
- Users will book the ground they want.  

# CASE 4
- For this lets assume that login will be built later.
- Use auth="pulic" for now to test it.
- Create a controller for listing futsal users.
    - Return list of futsal users
    - Return info about individual futsal user
